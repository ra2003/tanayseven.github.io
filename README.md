About the project:
------------------
This site was developed as my personal site without copy-pasting any of the online templates. One reason I did this was to get a hang of Twitter Bootstrap. Since this site is a personal site, it's made like a single page or a landing page. The major problem that I encountered was the stress to have a proper color combinations and pixel level resizing because this is more of a artistic designing type of project rathar than a software development kind. More than anything else, I'll be keeping this project as an opensource project so you can simply copy-paste it as a template as your own website.
